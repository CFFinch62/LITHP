# LITHP Icon - AI Image Generation Prompt

## For Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Adobe Firefly

---

### Concept Summary

LITHP is a Common Lisp IDE. Lisp = List Processor — so the icon shows a **factory assembly line** processing lists, viewed from the side. A conveyor belt runs left to right carrying items that are nested Lisp parentheses: `()` `(())` `((()))` `(())`  `()` — each one a list element being processed. Overhead, a robotic processing arm hangs from a ceiling rail, with a glowing **L** in its processor head — it is the LIST PROCESSOR itself. The entire palette is retro green monochrome on black — like a 1970s Lisp terminal. CRT scanlines, blinking cursor, terminal readout header. The floor displays actual Lisp code.

### Primary Prompt

A square app icon on a pure black background styled like a retro 1970s green-phosphor CRT computer terminal. The icon depicts a **factory assembly line viewed from the side**: a conveyor belt running left to right on two circular rollers, with five items sitting on the belt — each item is a small rectangular panel displaying nested Lisp parentheses: `()`, `(())`, `((()))`, `(())`, `()` in glowing green monospace text, labeled NIL, CDR, CAR, CONS, RET. The center item `((()))` is the brightest, actively being processed with a green glow emanating from above. Overhead, a **robotic processing arm** hangs from a horizontal ceiling rail that spans the width of the image, the arm dropping down to a boxy processor head unit directly above the center item. Inside the processor head glows a large capital letter **L** in bright white-green — the List Processor. A blinking cursor appears in a terminal header bar at the top. The floor below the belt displays a line of actual Lisp code: `(defun process (list) ...)`. CRT scanlines overlay the entire image. Everything is retro phosphor green (#00ff00 to #006600) on black — no other colors. Cinematic, high contrast, professional app icon, 1:1 square format.

### DALL-E 3 Specific Version

```
Create a professional square app icon on a pure black background in the style of a 1970s green phosphor CRT computer terminal. Design a factory assembly line viewed from the side: a horizontal conveyor belt running left to right on two cylindrical rollers. Five small rectangular items sit on the belt, each displaying nested Lisp parentheses in glowing green monospace font — from left to right: "()" labeled NIL, "(())" labeled CDR, "((()))" labeled CAR (brightest, center, being actively processed with a green glow from above), "(())" labeled CONS, and "()" labeled RET. Directly above the center item, a robotic processing arm hangs down from a horizontal ceiling rail that spans the full width. The arm ends in a boxy processor head unit containing a large glowing capital "L" in bright white-green — this is the List Processor. At the top of the image is a terminal header bar with green monospace text "LITHP v1.0  LIST-PROCESSOR > RUNNING_" and a blinking green cursor. The floor below shows a line of Lisp code in very dim green. CRT scanlines overlay the entire image. Entire palette is phosphor green on black — multiple shades of green only, no other colors. Professional icon style.

### Adobe Firefly / Generic Version

```
App icon: retro green phosphor CRT terminal style on black background, factory assembly line side view, conveyor belt with five items showing nested Lisp parentheses () (()) ((())) () in glowing green monospace, center item being processed by overhead robotic arm with glowing L in processor head, terminal header bar at top, Lisp code on floor, CRT scanlines, entirely green monochrome on black. Professional 1:1 square icon.

### Tips for Best Results

- This icon deliberately has NO upload reference match in the suite — the retro terminal style makes it unique
- If the assembly line looks too modern: *"style should look like a diagram on a 1970s green phosphor terminal, not a modern illustration"*
- If the L is too small: *"the L in the processor head should be readable at thumbnail size, the single brightest element"*
- If parentheses aren't distinct on each item: *"each conveyor item should clearly show different nesting depths of parentheses — (), (()), ((())) — as the key visual progression"*
- Key atmosphere note: *"CRT scanlines should be visible across the entire image, giving it the feeling of being viewed on an old monitor"*
- If colors drift from green: *"STRICTLY green phosphor monochrome — no blue, no white except the L glow, no warm tones whatsoever"*
